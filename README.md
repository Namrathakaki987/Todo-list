# Todo-list

This repository contains a simple front-end todo list application built using React. Users can view a list of todos and mark them as completed. The project serves as a basic example of using React components and state management to create an interactive web application. It includes components for displaying todos and a main App component to manage state. The project is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for building more complex todo list applications.
